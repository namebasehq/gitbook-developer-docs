# Decentralized website

## Overview

Conceptually creating a decentralized website using Handshake is very simple. You just need to upload your static content onto a decentralized storage provider and then pin the content address to your Handshake name.&#x20;

As an example, visit [niccarter/](https://niccarter.hns.to) to see [Nic Carter](https://twitter.com/nic\_\_carter)'s decentralized website â€” he used [dLinks](https://www.namebase.io/dlinks) which is a decentralized alternative to LinkTree built on Handshake and Skynet.

## Skynet

## Dynamic websites

It's becoming increasingly possible to create fully decentralized, dynamic websites by combining decentralized naming with decentralized storage and decentralized compute. Some examples of decentralized compute networks are Akash, a decentralized marketplace for cloud compute, Ethereum, the leading smart contract blockchain, and other smart contract blockchains like Polkadot, Flow, Near, etc.

Here's an example that combines Handshake with Skynet and Akash:&#x20;
