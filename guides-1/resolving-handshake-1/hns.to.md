# HNS.to

[HNS.to](https://hns.to) is a simple gateway that lets anyone visit Handshake websites without downloading special software or changing their computer settings. It's useful for sharing Handshake websites publicly with people who haven't used Handshake before. Note that anyone can create their own gateway and use that instead of using HNS.to.&#x20;

There are three ways to use HNS.to to visit a Handshake website

1. Go to [HNS.to](https://hns.to) and type in a Handshake domain in the search bar
2. Visit hns.to/{handshake\_domain} in your browser
3. Visit {handshake\_domain}.hns.to in your browser

Try visiting welcome.nb/ using each of the three methods above to test out HNS.to!

## HTTPS

You can resolve a root Handshake domain using HTTPS with HNS.to like [https:/nb.hns.to](https://nb.hns.to). Note that HNS.to is (currently) just a HTTP proxy so this will only secure the connection between your browser and HNS.to's servers â€” it does not secure the connection between HNS.to and the Handshake domain.

Subdomains like [http://welcome.nb.hns.to](http://welcome.nb.hns.to) do not support HTTPS because Wildcard Certs only support one level (https://\*.hns.to is supported but not https://\*.\*.hns.to).
